# CBETA_Matlab
All of the Matlab code I was involved with for the CBETA commissioning. Mainly the chromaticity measurement and associated Tune files.

These files are ran through EPICS to make the appropriate measurements on the machine.

Chromaticity is measured by measuring tunes at various beam energies and plotting the gradient. 

Chromaticity measurements are compared to tune at various energies from fieldmap data which is also included in this repo.
